# 📦 Java_Array Repository

Welcome to the **Java_Array** repository! This project is a complete reference for mastering arrays in Java, ranging from basic to advanced topics. It serves as a practice and learning hub for understanding how arrays work in Java, with plenty of examples.

This repository is divided into modules.

# 📁 Arrays_Class

The `Arrays_Class` module is a part of the larger `Java_Array` repository. It is dedicated to helping you understand and master **arrays in Java** — a fundamental data structure used to store fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type.

This module provides examples and explanations covering a wide variety of array-related concepts, including both beginner and intermediate levels.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### ✅ One-Dimensional Arrays
Learn how to declare, initialize, and use arrays that store a sequence of elements in a single row. Understand indexing, traversing, and basic operations like summing elements or finding the max/min.

### ✅ Two-Dimensional Arrays
Explore arrays with rows and columns, useful for working with matrices and tabular data. You will understand how to access elements using double indices and perform nested iterations.

### ✅ Dynamic 2D Arrays
Go beyond static declarations by dynamically allocating memory for rows and columns based on input or logic. This is useful when the size of your dataset isn't known at compile time.

### ✅ Jagged Arrays (Ragged Arrays)
Understand how to work with arrays of arrays, where each row can have a different length. This concept is particularly useful for memory optimization and when dealing with irregular data.

### ✅ Anonymous Arrays
Learn how to use arrays without explicitly declaring them by name. These are commonly used when arrays are needed only once, such as in method arguments.

### ✅ Arrays of Objects
Discover how to store object references in arrays, enabling object-oriented programming structures and interactions in a collection-like format.

### ✅ Passing Arrays to Methods
Understand how arrays can be passed as parameters to methods, and how to manipulate or process data from within those methods — promoting reusability and cleaner code.

### ✅ String Arrays
Explore arrays that store string values. Learn how to perform operations like searching, sorting, joining, and string manipulation within arrays.
