# 📦 Java_Array Repository

Welcome to the **Java_Array** repository! This project is a complete reference for mastering arrays in Java, ranging from basic to advanced topics. It serves as a practice and learning hub for understanding how arrays work in Java, with plenty of hands-on examples.

This repository is modular. One such module is:

---

# 📁 Arrays_Class

The `Arrays_Class` module is a part of the larger `Java_Array` repository. It focuses on mastering array manipulation in Java using both **core logic** and built-in utility methods from the `java.util.Arrays` class.

This module is perfect for learners aiming to understand how to operate on arrays efficiently using Java's standard library.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### ✅ One-Dimensional Arrays
Covers declaration, initialization, and traversal of simple linear arrays.

### ✅ Two-Dimensional Arrays
Introduces matrix-style data structures and nested looping techniques to access elements.

### ✅ Array Comparison
Learn how to compare one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays using methods like `Arrays.equals()` and `Arrays.deepEquals()`.

### ✅ Array Copying
Understand how to copy arrays partially or entirely using `Arrays.copyOf()` and `Arrays.copyOfRange()`.

### ✅ Binary Search on Arrays
Demonstrates how to search efficiently using `Arrays.binarySearch()` — a fast, sorted-search algorithm.

### ✅ Array Sorting
Use `Arrays.sort()` to sort arrays in ascending order — critical for performance optimization.

### ✅ Array Fill
Shows how to initialize or reset all array elements to a specific value using `Arrays.fill()`.

### ✅ Convert Arrays to Strings
Utilize `Arrays.toString()` and `Arrays.deepToString()` to get readable representations of arrays for debugging and logging.
